# Mandatory Consultation of CLAUDE.md

## Critical Rules
- **ALWAYS** read the `CLAUDE.md` file at the very beginning of a new chat or task, before making any plans or writing any code.
- Use the information in `CLAUDE.md` as the primary source of truth for project structure, coding conventions, architecture decisions, and development workflows.
- Any instructions in `CLAUDE.md` override other project rules unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- If there's a conflict between `CLAUDE.md` and other documentation, always defer to `CLAUDE.md`.

## How to Reference
- Use the command `@CLAUDE.md` to explicitly reference the file in your chat to ensure it is loaded into the context.
- After reading `CLAUDE.md`, confirm your understanding by summarizing the key constraints or patterns relevant to the current task.

<example>
**User Request:** "Add a new API endpoint for user profiles"

**Agent Behavior:**
1. First, reads `CLAUDE.md` to understand the project's API conventions, authentication requirements, and data models.
2. Then, proceeds to design and implement the endpoint according to the patterns found in `CLAUDE.md`.
